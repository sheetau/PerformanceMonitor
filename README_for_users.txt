Performance Monitor for Wallpaper Engine â€“ Safety Information
(The installation is complete so you don't necessarily need to read this.)

Performance Monitor is a lightweight application designed specifically for Wallpaper Engine web wallpapers. It collects system performance data and serves it locally so that your web wallpapers can access real-time metrics. When installed, it runs as a Windows service, operating in the background and automatically starting when the system boots.

- Built using Python and Flask for a simple, local performance monitoring environment.
- The tool runs entirely on your machine and does not send any data over the internet or access external servers.
- Performance statistics are collected locally and served only on localhost.
- The default endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:5000/performance) is only accessible from your own computer.
- Fully open-source: you can inspect the code at any time: https://github.com/sheetau/PerformanceMonitor.
