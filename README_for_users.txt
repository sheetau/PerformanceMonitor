Performance Monitor for Wallpaper Engine â€“ Safety Information
(The installation is complete so you don't necessarily need to read this.)

Performance Monitor is a lightweight application designed specifically for Wallpaper Engine web wallpapers. It collects system performance data and serves it locally so that your web wallpapers can access real-time metrics. When installed, it runs as a Windows service, operating in the background and automatically starting when the system boots.

- Built using Python and Flask for a simple, local performance monitoring environment.
- The tool runs entirely on your machine and does not send any data over the internet or access external servers.
- Performance statistics are collected locally and served only on localhost.
- The default endpoint (http://127.0.0.1:5000/performance) is only accessible from your own computer.
- Fully open-source: you can inspect the code at any time: https://github.com/sheetau/PerformanceMonitor.

Note on Security Warnings:
This executable is not code-signed, so some antivirus software may flag it as suspicious.
Additionally, because this tool runs as a standard Windows service using legitimate Service APIs, it operates in Session 0. This architecture is necessary for proper system integration and automatic startup, but it can unfortunately cause some user-level diagnostic tools (like Process Explorer or PowerShell's Get-Process) to fail in retrieving standard process metadata (e.g., Path, Company). This behavior is an inherent side effect of the service architecture, not a result of intentional anti-analysis or obfuscation techniques.**
It is safe to run. If you are concerned, you can review the source code in the GitHub repository or uninstall using the steps below. Please understand this is a personal, free project.

Stopping the Service:
1. Press Win + R, type services.msc, and press Enter.
2. Locate Performance Monitor Service in the list.
3. Right-click > Stop

Changing the Port:
1. Create a config.json file in the same folder as PerformanceMonitor.exe with:
{
  "port": 5000
}
2. Modify the port number as needed.
3. Restart the service in services.msc.

Uninstalling:
Run the included uninstaller.bat as Administrator (This will stop and delete Performance Monitor service, Kill any remaining PerformanceMonitor.exe processes, and Delete PerformanceMonitor.exe itself).
